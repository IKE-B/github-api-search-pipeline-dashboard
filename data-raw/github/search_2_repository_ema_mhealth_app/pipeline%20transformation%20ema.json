      "description": "In this program we will build email spam classifier using naive bayes algorithm. We will use sklearn CountVectorizer to convert email text into a matrix of numbers and then use sklearn MultinomialNB classifier to train our model. The model score with this approach comes out to be very high (around 98%). Sklearn pipeline allows us to handle pre processing transformations easily with its convenient api.",
